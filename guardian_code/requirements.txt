# Common dependencies for the Guardian function

# Cloud-specific dependencies (e.g., google-cloud-compute, boto3) will be
# defined in separate files like 'requirements-gcp.txt' or
# 'requirements-aws.txt' and will be automatically included by the
# corresponding backend during the packaging process.

# The SkyPilot library itself will be packaged directly from the local
# installation, so it is not listed here.
